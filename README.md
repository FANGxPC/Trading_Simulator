## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **State Persistence:**  
  - On load, the app checks for saved portfolio, balance, and transaction history in localStorage.
  - All changes (trades, price updates) are automatically saved every 30 seconds and before closing the page.
  - Use the **Reset** button to clear all saved data and restart with default values.

- **Live Market Simulation:**  
  - Stock prices update every few seconds, simulating real-world market volatility, trends, and news events.
  - Charts and tables update in real time for an engaging trading experience.

- **Trading:**  
  - Buy or sell stocks using the trade form.
  - Portfolio and transaction history update instantly.
